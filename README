IN PROGRESS

Workflow script to automate ingest of floppy disks (3.5" and 5.25") using kryoflux two-drive setup and attached camera. 

Basically, script takes some args like media type and call number, 
takes a picture of the disk, 
pulls metadata from json returned from catalog call, 
runs appropriate kryoflux dtc commands (takes stream + MFM by default), 
names and places files where I want them, 
updates metadata and project logs

Script does not verify success (e.g. image is mountable, files can be extracted/performed)

note: this is super environment-specific, institution-specific, but could be modified.
