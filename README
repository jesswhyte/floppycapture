IN PROGRESS

Workflow script to automate ingest of floppy disks (3.5" and 5.25") using kryoflux two-drive setup and attached camera. 

Basically, script takes some args like media type and call number, 
takes a picture of the disk, 
pulls metadata from json returned from catalog call, 
runs appropriate kryoflux dtc commands (takes stream + MFM by default), 
names and places files where I want them, 
updates metadata and project logs

Script does not verify success (e.g. if the image is mountable and files can be extracted/performed). That process is separate.
Also working on method to test streams against a variety of image types (if image type unknown), suggestions welcome. 

note: this is super environment-specific, institution-specific, but could be modified.
